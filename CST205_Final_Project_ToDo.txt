CST 205 - Final Project

To-do
########################

- Necromancer invisible until attacks

- Design for clues to "winning" grave

- Read command that can read a gravestone which delivers a clue

- Dig command that will attempt to dig the grave

- Player frozen for (1 or 2) turns if they dig wrong grave

- Concept Decision: Should the player's movement be increased to 128 pixels (up from 64)?

- Tommyknocker sprite added to game images (sprite is already completed)

- Command to drop a tommyknocker

- Tommyknocker is visible on screen until necromancer "attacks" it (destroyed after)

- Necromancer switches targets from player to tommyknocker if tommyknocker is present on screen

- Victory condition

- Victory screen

- Intro screen after title (will include controls)

- Additional prompt screens (like the one implemented that tells user they can't move a certain direction)

- Sound effects:

	- Necromancer laugh

	- Player hit (maybe preceded by an attack sound from necro)

	- Grave digging

	- Maybe: Footfalls while moving

	- Player frozen (maybe ghost sound effect)

Stretch goals:

- Ghost appears when player is frozen (have possible sprite)

- Necromancer's sprite faces the player when attacking (directional sprites are already in folder)

- Death animation for player and/or necromancer
